## Challenges

## Improvments

If we had more time, we would work to get our laser scan, points, and robot model working correctly and aligned with the ground truth. With that working, we would be able to better tune our algorithm with the dynamic reconfigure.

## Lessons learned

We learned a lot about numpy which we will definitely use on future robotics projects. We also learned how to implement a dynamic reconfigure server and client. This drastically improves the ease of testing different values without having to hardcode the values and rerun the node every time.
